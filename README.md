Given a JSON file with a list of people and their dates of birth, write a program to print out the people whose birthday is today.

If a person was born on Feb 29th, then their birthday during a non-leap year should be considered to be Feb 28th.

Input sample file:

```
[
    ["Doe", "John", "1982/10/08"],
    ["Wayne", "Bruce", "1965/01/30"],
    ["Gaga", "Lady", "1986/03/28"],
    ["Curry", "Mark", "1988/02/29"]
]
```
